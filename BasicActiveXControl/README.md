# Basic ActiveXControl

Simple project for demonstrating the basic process of ActiveXControl creation:

* Implementing an assembly and a class that is COM-visible, see `MyActiveXControl`
* Registration of the assembly afterbuild, see project properties
* If build fails you can remove temporarely the unregister action
* An example application in form of an excel user form, open 'BasicActiveXControlForm.xlsm'
