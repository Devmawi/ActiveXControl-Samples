# Registration Free ActiveX Controls

Simple Project for demonstrating the development of ActiveX Controls that can be used in VBA Editor:

* Drag/Drop the control in custom user form
* Drag/Drop in work sheet
* Setting properties in property window
* Provide intellisense in VBA editor

> Important: If want to change the `Interface` of a ActiveX Control, you have to update the assembly version, so that EXCEL can recognize the changes.
